# Project Proposal 
## Bank of Base Camp
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a banking program. Our program will have different features. For example, being able to deposit and withdraw currency, setting a budget for your account, and being able to have a savings account. When the user creates an account they will be given an account number and have to create a pin to log into their account. They will be able to set the currency to whatever their home country's currency is. Our banking program will also have a feature for scheduling payments on a specific day of their choosing. Our motivation for this is to give users a program where they can keep track of their money and start saving money.
