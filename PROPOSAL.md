# Project Proposal 
## Bank of Base Camp
### Description and Motivation:
In this project, we want to build a banking program. Our program will have different features. For example, being able to deposit and withdraw currency, setting a budget for your account, and being able to have a savings account. When the user creates an account they will be given an account number and have to create a pin to log into their account. They will be able to set the currency to whatever their home country's currency is. Our banking program will also have a feature for scheduling payments on a specific day of their choosing. Our motivation for this is to give users a program where they can keep track of their money and start saving money. 

### Prior Art:
Prior arts would be Banking apps like Ally Bank, Bank of America, Capital One, Huntington Bank, and Wells Fargo. Our project would work like these banking apps allowing people to make bank account and save there money they deposited and be able to "sign in" to view the money in their account. It would also allow them to convert the money in their account to any currency available like the apps money convertors XE Currency, CalConvert, Currency Convert, My Currency Converter, Valuta+.

### Core User Workflows:
- The user can deposit and withdraw money from the bank.
- The user can move money into a savings account. 
- The user can also set up an budget for a week and be notified when they go over the budget.
- We want the user to be able to create an account with a username and pin.
- Admin can view all account information.
- The user can converts currency into the currency of other countries.
- Lastly, the user will be able to schedule payments on specifc days and withdraw from account.
